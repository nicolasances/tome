                explanation: `You're mostly correct! The Crusaders did indeed refuse al-Afdalâ€™s offer, stating they would enter Jerusalem by force. The key point is that they were deeply motivated by religious fervor and saw the conquest of Jerusalem as a divine mission. Their commitment to reclaiming Jerusalem "in arms" was fueled by the belief that it was a holy task, and they were unwilling to settle for anything less than outright control of the city. Nice job! Just a bit more detail about their religious motivations would have made your answer even more complete. Keep it up!`
