# Tome

Tome is a web app to help memorize information read. 

Tome is based on a **Knowlege Base**, that is built upon a series of blogs, articles, books, and other documents that the user has read.

## The Core Concepts

Tome revoles around simple concepts: 

1. **Topic** <br>
A Topic is something you need to remember. <br>
It can be a book, an article, anything.

2. **Flashcards** <br>
Flashcards are "memory cards". They are different types of card that are supposed to help the memorization of a Topic. <br>
Examples could be cards with multiple options to choose from, fill-the-missing-text flashcards, timeline flashcards, etc. 

3. **Practice** <br>
A Practice is a session where the user reviews a topic. It can be the user going through a series of flashcards meant to accelerate memorization, etc. 
<br>

4. **Practice Points** (pp) <br>
Every time a user fills question he/she gets practice points (pp). Practice points are used then to measure progress and are used as part of Challenges. 

5. **Badges** <br>
Badges help gamify the practice and memorization of topics. 
Badges get emitted at the reaching of specific goals, often described in terms of Practice Points (but could be related to other metrics).
