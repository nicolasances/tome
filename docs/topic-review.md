# Topic Review

Tome is centered around the concept of a *Topic*. <br>
The Topic has multiple Sections, and that split exists mostly because of LLM limitations, but what needs to be reviewed, from a UX perspective, is the *Topic*. 

The **Topic Review** is a 360Â° review of a given Topic. 

Reviewing a topic does not mean reviewing each single section, but it means reviewing the topic as a whole, not just focusing on one section or on one section at a time.
